<fabo> liuyq: we have a mainline U-Boot CI
<liuyq> fabo, is there any release for that link? I see there is latest  in the link, it might be changed. but for test report in the future, we need to write with a fix url, and I think lava said also needs to use a fixed version of the firmware
<liuyq> s/said/side/
<fabo> liuyq: we don't flash u-boot each time. if you really need a fixed version for doc purpose, ask the lab to mirror it
