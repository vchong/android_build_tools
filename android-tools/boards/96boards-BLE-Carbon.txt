Carbon is the first board to be certified 96Boards IoT Edition compatible.
The Carbon packs a Cortex-M4 chip, 512KB onboard flash, built in Bluetooth,
and a 30-pin low speed expansion header capable of up to 3.3V digital and analog GPIO.
Carbon currently runs Zephyr, which is a small, scalable, real-time OS for use on resource-constrained systems.
