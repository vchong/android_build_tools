Carbon is the first board to be certified 96Boards IoT Edition compatible.
The Carbon packs a Cortex-M4 chip, 512KB onboard flash, built in Bluetooth,
and a 30-pin low speed expansion header capable of up to 3.3V digital and analog GPIO.
Carbon currently runs Zephyr, which is a small, scalable, real-time OS for use on resource-constrained systems.

STM32F4 has two external oscillators. The frequency of the slow clock is 32.768 kHz. The frequency of the main clock is 16 MHz.
Zephyr applications use the 96b_carbon configuration to run on the 96Boards Carbon hardware. It is based on the STMicroelectronics STM32F401RET Cortex-M4 CPU and also contains a nRF51832 chip connected over SPI for BLE connectivity.
