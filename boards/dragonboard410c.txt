Hi,
I've finished updating stuff to build, and cleaned up some of the more messy bits.

To grab the source:

repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest.git -b android-6.0.0_r26
repo sync
cd .repo
git clone -b linaro-marshmallow-dragonboard git://android-git.linaro.org/platform/manifest.git local_manifests
cd ..
repo sync

Unfortunately, even freedreno relies on some firmware files we can't just add to git for legal reasons, so grab the Ubuntu (not Android!) BSP from
https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c/tools
and unzip it.

https://developer.qualcomm.com/download/db410c/android_board_support_package_vla.br_.1.2.7-01010-8x16.0-4.zip


to build:

. build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_dragonboard410c-userdebug
make droidcore -j18 ADRENO_FIRMWARE=.../linux-ubuntu-board-support-package-v1.1/proprietary-ubuntu

Other than rebasing to M and cleaning up some messes, this is what we had at the end of Connect, so don't expect it to boot to UI just yet...
But it'll be a good starting point.
